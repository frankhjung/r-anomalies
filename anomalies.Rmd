# Introduction

Anomalies are patterns in data that do not conform to a well-defined notion of
normal behaviour.  There are many different algorithms for anomaly detection
spanning different categories [@ChandolaBK2009].  In a recent article
[@Niculaescu2018] the author used a CUSUM algorithm to detect anomalies.
However, the details of how this was performed was scant.  Consequently, we
decided to replicate the results.  This was done to a gain an understanding of
the methods used and how the reporting was performed.



## Detecting Changes using CUSUM

The [CUSUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUSUM) algorithm is used to test for
anomalies. This requires two parameters: *threshold* and *drift*. But, how do
you choose values for these parameters? [@Gustafsson2000] provides this recipe:

* Start with a very large *threshold*.
* Choose *drift* to one half of the expected change, or adjust drift such that `g = 0` more than 50% of the time.
* Then set the *threshold* so the required number of false alarms (this can be done automatically) or delay for detection is obtained.
* If faster detection is sought, try to decrease *drift*.
* If fewer false alarms are wanted, try to increase *drift*.
* If there is a subset of the change times that does not make sense, try to increase *drift*.

Here we are using
[cusum](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/qcc/versions/2.6/topics/cusum)
from the [Quality Control Charts (qcc)
package](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/qcc/).


# Evaluation

See [@Eskin2000].


# Further Work

Here we have replicated the results from [@Niculaescu2018].  This used the CUSUM
algorithm.  However, there are numerous other algorithms worth
investigating[@ChandolaBK2009]. One that is designed for time series data is
"Seasonal Hybrid ESD" [@HochenbaumVK2017] from Twitter. This is available an
open source package,
[AnomalyDetection](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection).
